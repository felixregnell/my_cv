I am currently taking a course in Efficient C programming (course code EDAG01), extra credits, in order to learn more about how high level programming languages are compiled to the computer architecture. I find the connection between hardware and software intriguing; how the code I write is optimized and executed; how to write high performance code according to hardware constraints and capabilities; how data structures are represented in memory and their complexity. I am thinking of specializing in embedded systems, and next year I am considering the following courses: Multicore Programming, Computer Architecture, and Compilers.
